# CYW920739M2EVB-01

### Overview

The Infineon CYW920739M2EVB-01 Evaluation kit enables you to evaluate and develop solutions using the AIROC&#8482; CYW20739 multi-protocol system on chip. The CYW20739 is an ultra-low-power multi-protocol SoC with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth LE and Matter over Thread. The CYW20739 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the device's footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market.
